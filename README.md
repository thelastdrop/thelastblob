# The Last Drop

The blobs originated from planet BlobLoblob, which was destroyed by the federation of planets as a preemptive strike, right before they could build their first warp drive. But the most intelligent blob was capable of stealing a stealth ship used by the federation to launch the attack, and now he will try to avenge his blobs!


The blob is last remaining of a race of predatory blobs. The blob is vulnerable to condensed light and laser. The lasers, the most powerful weapon the federation has, only barely dent the blob. When it's hit by a laser, part of the blob becomes plasma, blocking any ray. The blob need organic matters to sustain, when it "eats" organic matters, it grows. It canâ€™t stay long on planets at direct contact with sun light thanks to ultraviolet radiations that slowly evaporate him.


The blob is able to "stretch" a pseudopode from himself towards the direction that he chose. He can also slide in a direction(left, right), following the wall and this will allow it to move under small gaps. It will stick to the surface it is, until it "move" away from it.
